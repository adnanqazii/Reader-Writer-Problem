# Reader-Writer-Synchronization
This project is one way to solve reader-writer synchronization problem in which we have to prevent other processes from accessing a file while it is being changed. It gives readers more priority over writers.
The code also shows how to call a custom or your own system call.
The 'system call creation' document shows how to create system calls in the linux kernel version the document shows.

Made for 'Operating Systems(OS)' course.
